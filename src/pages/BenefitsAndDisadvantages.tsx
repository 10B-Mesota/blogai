              Advantages and Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With all the hype around Artificial Intelligence - robots,
              self-driving cars, etc. - it can be easy to assume that AI
              doesn&rsquo;t impact our everyday lives. In reality, most of us
              encounter Artificial Intelligence in some way or the other almost
              every single day. From the moment you wake up to check your
              smartphone to watching another Netflix recommended movie, AI has
              quickly made its way into our everyday lives. According to a study
              by Statista, the global AI market is set to grow up to 54 percent
              every single year. But what exactly is AI? Will it really serve
              good to mankind in the future? Well, there are tons of advantages
              and disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence which we&rsquo;ll
              discuss in this article.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">What is Artificial Intelligence?</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Before we jump on to the advantages and disadvantages of
              Artificial Intelligence, let us understand what is AI in the first
              place. From a birds eye view, AI provides a computer program the
              ability to think and learn on its own. It is a simulation of human
              intelligence (hence, artificial) into machines to do things that
              we would normally rely on humans. There are three main types of AI
              based on its capabilities - weak AI, strong AI, and super AI.
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Weak AI - Focuses on one task and cannot perform beyond its
                  limitations (common in our daily lives)
                </p>
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Strong AI - Can understand and learn any intellectual task
                  that a human being can (researchers are striving to reach
                  strong AI)
                </p>
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Super AI - Surpasses human intelligence and can perform any
                  task better than a human (still a concept)
                </p>
                <br />
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-xl">
              Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              An artificial intelligence program is a program that is capable of
              learning and thinking. It is possible to consider anything to be
              artificial intelligence if it consists of a program performing a
              task that we would normally assume a human would perform.
              Let&apos;s begin with the advantages of artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">1. Reduction in Human Error</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the biggest advantages of Artificial Intelligence is that
              it can significantly reduce errors and increase accuracy and
              precision. The decisions taken by AI in every step is decided by
              information previously gathered and a certain set of algorithms.
              When programmed properly, these errors can be reduced to
              null.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">2. Zero Risks</p>
            <p>
              Another big advantage of AI is that humans can overcome many risks
              by letting AI robots do them for us. Whether it be defusing a
              bomb, going to space, exploring the deepest parts of oceans,
              machines with metal bodies are resistant in nature and can survive
              unfriendly atmospheres. Moreover, they can provide accurate work
              with greater responsibility and not wear out easily.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">3. 24x7 Availability</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There are many studies that show humans are productive only about
              3 to 4 hours in a day. Humans also need breaks and time offs to
              balance their work life and personal life. But AI can work
              endlessly without breaks. They think much faster than humans and
              perform multiple tasks at a time with accurate results. They can
              even handle tedious repetitive jobs easily with the help of AI
              algorithms.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">4. Digital Assistance</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Some of the most technologically advanced companies engage with
              users using digital assistants, which eliminates the need for
              human personnel. Many websites utilize digital assistants to
              deliver user-requested content. We can discuss our search with
              them in conversation. Some chatbots are built in a way that makes
              it difficult to tell whether we are conversing with a human or a
              chatbot.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We all know that businesses have a customer service crew that must
              address the doubts and concerns of the patrons. Businesses can
              create a chatbot or voice bot that can answer all of their
              clients&apos; questions using AI.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">5. New Inventions</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In practically every field, AI is the driving force behind
              numerous innovations that will aid humans in resolving the
              majority of challenging issues.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For instance, recent advances in AI-based technologies have
              allowed doctors to detect breast cancer in a woman at an earlier
              stage.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">6. Unbiased Decisions</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Human beings are driven by emotions, whether we like it or not. AI
              on the other hand, is devoid of emotions and highly practical and
              rational in its approach. A huge advantage of Artificial
              Intelligence is that it doesn&apos;t have any biased views, which
              ensures more accurate decision-making.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">7. Perform Repetitive Jobs</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We will be doing a lot of repetitive tasks as part of our daily
              work, such as checking documents for flaws and mailing thank-you
              notes, among other things. We may use artificial intelligence to
              efficiently automate these menial chores and even eliminate
              &quot;boring&quot; tasks for people, allowing them to focus on
              being more creative.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Example: In banks, it&apos;s common to see multiple document
              checks to obtain a loan, which is a time-consuming task for the
              bank&apos;s owner. The owner can expedite the document
              verification process for the advantage of both the clients and the
              owner by using AI Cognitive Automation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">8. Daily Applications</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Today, our everyday lives are entirely dependent on mobile devices
              and the internet. We utilize a variety of apps, including Google
              Maps, Alexa, Siri, Cortana on Windows, OK Google, taking selfies,
              making calls, responding to emails, etc. With the use of various
              AI-based techniques, we can also anticipate today&rsquo;s weather
              and the days ahead.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Example: About 20 years ago, you must have asked someone who had
              already been there for instructions when you were planning a trip.
              All you need to do now is ask Google where Bangalore is. The best
              route between you and Bangalore will be displayed, along with
              Bangalore&apos;s location, on a Google map.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">9. AI in Risky Situations</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the main benefits of artificial intelligence is this. By
              creating an AI robot that can perform perilous tasks on our
              behalf, we can get beyond many of the dangerous restrictions that
              humans face. It can be utilized effectively in any type of natural
              or man-made calamity, whether it be going to Mars, defusing a
              bomb, exploring the deepest regions of the oceans, or mining for
              coal and oil.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For instance, the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power
              facility in Ukraine. As any person who came close to the core
              would have perished in a matter of minutes, at the time, there
              were no AI-powered robots that could assist us in reducing the
              effects of radiation by controlling the fire in its early phases.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">1. High Costs</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The ability to create a machine that can simulate human
              intelligence is no small feat. It requires plenty of time and
              resources and can cost a huge deal of money. AI also needs to
              operate on the latest hardware and software to stay updated and
              meet the latest requirements, thus making it quite costly.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">2. No creativity</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              A big disadvantage of AI is that it cannot learn to think outside
              the box. AI is capable of learning over time with pre-fed data and
              past experiences, but cannot be creative in its approach. A
              classic example is the bot Quill who can write Forbes earning
              reports. These reports only contain data and facts already
              provided to the bot. Although it is impressive that a bot can
              write an article on its own, it lacks the human touch present in
              other Forbes articles.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">3. Unemployment</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One application of artificial intelligence is a robot, which is
              displacing occupations and increasing unemployment (in a few
              cases). Therefore, some claim that there is always a chance of
              unemployment as a result of chatbots and robots replacing
              humans.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For instance, robots are frequently utilized to replace human
              resources in manufacturing businesses in some more technologically
              advanced nations like Japan. This is not always the case, though,
              as it creates additional opportunities for humans to work while
              also replacing humans in order to increase efficiency.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">4. Make Humans Lazy</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              AI applications automate the majority of tedious and repetitive
              tasks. Since we do not have to memorize things or solve puzzles to
              get the job done, we tend to use our brains less and less. This
              addiction to AI can cause problems to future generations.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">5. No Ethics</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Ethics and morality are important human features that can be
              difficult to incorporate into an AI. The rapid progress of AI has
              raised a number of concerns that one day, AI will grow
              uncontrollably, and eventually wipe out humanity. This moment is
              referred to as the AI singularity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">6. Emotionless</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Since early childhood, we have been taught that neither computers
              nor other machines have feelings. Humans function as a team, and
              team management is essential for achieving goals. However, there
              is no denying that robots are superior to humans when functioning
              effectively, but it is also true that human connections, which
              form the basis of teams, cannot be replaced by computers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">7. No Improvement</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Humans cannot develop artificial intelligence because it is a
              technology based on pre-loaded facts and experience. AI is
              proficient at repeatedly carrying out the same task, but if we
              want any adjustments or improvements, we must manually alter the
              codes. AI cannot be accessed and utilized akin to human
              intelligence, but it can store infinite data.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Machines can only complete tasks they have been developed or
              programmed for; if they are asked to complete anything else, they
              frequently fail or provide useless results, which can have
              significant negative effects. Thus, we are unable to make anything
              conventional.
