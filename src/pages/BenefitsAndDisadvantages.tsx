          <p>Advantages and Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</p>
          <p>
            With all the hype around Artificial Intelligence - robots,
            self-driving cars, etc. - it can be easy to assume that AI
            doesn&rsquo;t impact our everyday lives. In reality, most of us
            encounter Artificial Intelligence in some way or the other almost
            every single day. From the moment you wake up to check your
            smartphone to watching another Netflix recommended movie, AI has
            quickly made its way into our everyday lives. According to a study
            by Statista, the global AI market is set to grow up to 54 percent
            every single year. But what exactly is AI? Will it really serve good
            to mankind in the future? Well, there are tons of advantages and
            disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence which we&rsquo;ll discuss
            in this article.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>What is Artificial Intelligence?</p>
          <p>
            Before we jump on to the advantages and disadvantages of Artificial
            Intelligence, let us understand what is AI in the first place. From
            a birds eye view, AI provides a computer program the ability to
            think and learn on its own. It is a simulation of human intelligence
            (hence, artificial) into machines to do things that we would
            normally rely on humans. There are three main types of AI based on
            its capabilities - weak AI, strong AI, and super AI.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Weak AI - Focuses on one task and cannot perform beyond its
                limitations (common in our daily lives)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Strong AI - Can understand and learn any intellectual task that
                a human being can (researchers are striving to reach strong AI)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Super AI - Surpasses human intelligence and can perform any task
                better than a human (still a concept)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</p>
          <p>
            An artificial intelligence program is a program that is capable of
            learning and thinking. It is possible to consider anything to be
            artificial intelligence if it consists of a program performing a
            task that we would normally assume a human would perform. Let&apos;s
            begin with the advantages of artificial intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</p>
          <p>1. Reduction in Human Error</p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest advantages of Artificial Intelligence is that it
            can significantly reduce errors and increase accuracy and precision.
            The decisions taken by AI in every step is decided by information
            previously gathered and a certain set of algorithms. When programmed
            properly, these errors can be reduced to null.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>2. Zero Risks</p>
          <p>
            Another big advantage of AI is that humans can overcome many risks
            by letting AI robots do them for us. Whether it be defusing a bomb,
            going to space, exploring the deepest parts of oceans, machines with
            metal bodies are resistant in nature and can survive unfriendly
            atmospheres. Moreover, they can provide accurate work with greater
            responsibility and not wear out easily.
          </p>
          <p>3. 24x7 Availability</p>
          <p>
            There are many studies that show humans are productive only about 3
            to 4 hours in a day. Humans also need breaks and time offs to
            balance their work life and personal life. But AI can work endlessly
            without breaks. They think much faster than humans and perform
            multiple tasks at a time with accurate results. They can even handle
            tedious repetitive jobs easily with the help of AI algorithms.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>4. Digital Assistance</p>
          <p>
            Some of the most technologically advanced companies engage with
            users using digital assistants, which eliminates the need for human
            personnel. Many websites utilize digital assistants to deliver
            user-requested content. We can discuss our search with them in
            conversation. Some chatbots are built in a way that makes it
            difficult to tell whether we are conversing with a human or a
            chatbot.
          </p>
          <p>
            We all know that businesses have a customer service crew that must
            address the doubts and concerns of the patrons. Businesses can
            create a chatbot or voice bot that can answer all of their
            clients&apos; questions using AI.

          <p>5. New Inventions</p>
          <p>
            In practically every field, AI is the driving force behind numerous
            innovations that will aid humans in resolving the majority of
            challenging issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, recent advances in AI-based technologies have allowed
            doctors to detect breast cancer in a woman at an earlier stage.
          </p>
          <p>6. Unbiased Decisions</p>
          <p>
            Human beings are driven by emotions, whether we like it or not. AI
            on the other hand, is devoid of emotions and highly practical and
            rational in its approach. A huge advantage of Artificial
            Intelligence is that it doesn&apos;t have any biased views, which
            ensures more accurate decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>7. Perform Repetitive Jobs</p>
          <p>
            We will be doing a lot of repetitive tasks as part of our daily
            work, such as checking documents for flaws and mailing thank-you
            notes, among other things. We may use artificial intelligence to
            efficiently automate these menial chores and even eliminate
            &quot;boring&quot; tasks for people, allowing them to focus on being
            more creative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: In banks, it&apos;s common to see multiple document checks
            to obtain a loan, which is a time-consuming task for the bank&apos;s
            owner. The owner can expedite the document verification process for
            the advantage of both the clients and the owner by using AI
            Cognitive Automation.
          </p>
          <p>8. Daily Applications</p>
          <p>
            Today, our everyday lives are entirely dependent on mobile devices
            and the internet. We utilize a variety of apps, including Google
            Maps, Alexa, Siri, Cortana on Windows, OK Google, taking selfies,
            making calls, responding to emails, etc. With the use of various
            AI-based techniques, we can also anticipate today&rsquo;s weather
            and the days ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: About 20 years ago, you must have asked someone who had
            already been there for instructions when you were planning a trip.
            All you need to do now is ask Google where Bangalore is. The best
            route between you and Bangalore will be displayed, along with
            Bangalore&apos;s location, on a Google map.
          </p>
          <p>9. AI in Risky Situations</p>
          <p>
            One of the main benefits of artificial intelligence is this. By
            creating an AI robot that can perform perilous tasks on our behalf,
            we can get beyond many of the dangerous restrictions that humans
            face. It can be utilized effectively in any type of natural or
            man-made calamity, whether it be going to Mars, defusing a bomb,
            exploring the deepest regions of the oceans, or mining for coal and
            oil.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power facility
            in Ukraine. As any person who came close to the core would have
            perished in a matter of minutes, at the time, there were no
            AI-powered robots that could assist us in reducing the effects of
            radiation by controlling the fire in its early phases.
          </p>
          <p>Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</p>
          <p>1. High Costs</p>
          <p>
            The ability to create a machine that can simulate human intelligence
            is no small feat. It requires plenty of time and resources and can
            cost a huge deal of money. AI also needs to operate on the latest
            hardware and software to stay updated and meet the latest
            requirements, thus making it quite costly.
          </p>
          <p>2. No creativity</p>
          <p>
            A big disadvantage of AI is that it cannot learn to think outside
            the box. AI is capable of learning over time with pre-fed data and
            past experiences, but cannot be creative in its approach. A classic
            example is the bot Quill who can write Forbes earning reports. These
            reports only contain data and facts already provided to the bot.
            Although it is impressive that a bot can write an article on its
            own, it lacks the human touch present in other Forbes
            articles.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>3. Unemployment</p>
          <p>
            One application of artificial intelligence is a robot, which is
            displacing occupations and increasing unemployment (in a few cases).
            Therefore, some claim that there is always a chance of unemployment
            as a result of chatbots and robots replacing humans.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, robots are frequently utilized to replace human
            resources in manufacturing businesses in some more technologically
            advanced nations like Japan. This is not always the case, though, as
            it creates additional opportunities for humans to work while also
            replacing humans in order to increase efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>4. Make Humans Lazy</p>
          <p>
            AI applications automate the majority of tedious and repetitive
            tasks. Since we do not have to memorize things or solve puzzles to
            get the job done, we tend to use our brains less and less. This
            addiction to AI can cause problems to future generations.
          </p>
          <p>5. No Ethics</p>
          <p>
            Ethics and morality are important human features that can be
            difficult to incorporate into an AI. The rapid progress of AI has
            raised a number of concerns that one day, AI will grow
            uncontrollably, and eventually wipe out humanity. This moment is
            referred to as the AI singularity.
          </p>
          <p>6. Emotionless</p>
          <p>
            Since early childhood, we have been taught that neither computers
            nor other machines have feelings. Humans function as a team, and
            team management is essential for achieving goals. However, there is
            no denying that robots are superior to humans when functioning
            effectively, but it is also true that human connections, which form
            the basis of teams, cannot be replaced by computers.
          </p>
          <p>7. No Improvement</p>
          <p>
            Humans cannot develop artificial intelligence because it is a
            technology based on pre-loaded facts and experience. AI is
            proficient at repeatedly carrying out the same task, but if we want
            any adjustments or improvements, we must manually alter the codes.
            AI cannot be accessed and utilized akin to human intelligence, but
            it can store infinite data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Machines can only complete tasks they have been developed or
            programmed for; if they are asked to complete anything else, they
            frequently fail or provide useless results, which can have
            significant negative effects. Thus, we are unable to make anything
            conventional.
